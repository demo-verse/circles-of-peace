## Circles of Peace aka. Circles for Impact

Circles of Peace (to be launched on circlesforimpact . org in the following weeks, is being built using the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) that developers can use to created decentralized and composable social applications / features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers).

It'll be embedded to our community discussion layer, and will be gated for those expressed and acknowledged peace, and given that assurance as citizen or world resident behaviours, as of Expression of Peace V3 and Acknowledgement of Peace V2 as well deployed in parallel. 

@ https://demoVer.se and https://expressionsofpeace.org, we'll be using Orbis Protocol, so will not be relying solely on centralized alternatives for resilience and transparency being on top priority for us.
