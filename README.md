## Circles of Peace, a gateway to Circles for Impact
In the main project, [demoVer.se](https://demoVer.se), we'll be using Orbis Protocol, so will not be relying solely on centralized alternatives for resilience and transparency being on top priority for us. 

Circles of Peace* , is being built using the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) that developers can use to created decentralized and composable social applications and features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers). 

Peacemakers that have expressed and acknowledged peace, and given that assurance, will be invited to Circles of Peace (social component) and Circles for Impact (metaverse-like virtual spacse, eg. welo.space and gather.town).


In those environments/spaces, we'll be observing people, as sovereign individuals, taken the least effort on being equal on peace and trust making, via a mimicry of peace-oriented diplomacy, as that's being decentralised, for the 21st century.

It'll be embedded to our community discussion layer, and be a gateway to Circles for Impact. 

Peace, as a start:
--
Good news: as we use our right on being equal on peace and trust making, and express & acknowledge that for one another explicitly, we are somehow, already fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goals [10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10), [16](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16) and [17](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17), before moving into the Circles for Impact.

Through Expressions and Acknowledgements of Peace (and later with Attestations and Recognitions of Peace)m

*SDG#10:* Reduced inequalities within and among countries: In our case, it's also among people.

Remember? It's your right now to be a co-signer/sealer of a world peace treaty, even if you are not head of a state.


*SDG#16:* Peace, justice and strong institutions


*SDG#17:* Partnerships for the goals

So that's the consensus we got there, and a common understanding and a high level of generosity and intentionality. Well, internationality as well :)


Circles are being designed to be a [metaverse-like virtual spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7AvWng7J8), for impact generating and scaling learnings and cooperations around making of [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) and [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/) centric (and more) projects.


along with finalising resolutions in a [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) experience as they developed in time. That's how good it's gotta be.
