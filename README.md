## Circles of Peace for +Impact 
## aka. ~ Circles for +Impact
In the main project, [demoVerse](https://demoVer.se), and focused one, [Expressions of Peace](https://expressionsofpeace.org),  we'll be incorporating and collaborating with Orbis Protocol, as social layer of peace and trust-making; as resilience and transparency being on top priority for our efforts, all along.

Circles of Peace for +Impact* , is being built on top of the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) and its use case, [Orbis groups](https://app.orbis.club) this very repository is forked. 

With these infrastructure, developers can use to create decentralized and composable social applications and features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers). 



## Peace, as a start:

Peacemakers that have expressed and acknowledged peace through Circles of Peace, and given that assurance, will be invited to Circles for Impact, a metaverse-like virtual spaces, eg. welo.space and gather.town is considered to start with.

In those spaces, we'll be observing people, as sovereign individuals, taken the least effort on being equal on peace and trust making, via a mimicry of peace-oriented diplomacy, as that's being decentralised, for the 21st century.

Through Expressions, Acknowledgements, Reflections and later Attestations of Peace, we'd like to interpret basic social media interactions for an initial set of decentralized peace and trust making activities.

This platform, Circles of Peace for +Impact, aka. Circles for Impact, is a gateway to come together and give the least assurance to the rest of the world, as citizens or as-is, by default as world residents.


<!-- We will be sending $peace and $wisdom tokens and one of  official/platform NFTs dedicated by artists in our existing community on discord, for you to access to Peacemakers community on orbis.club // there you will be invited to Circles for Impact, right away.

Good news: as we use our right on being equal on peace and trust making, and express & acknowledge that for one another explicitly, we are somehow, already fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goals [10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10), [16](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16) and [17](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17), before moving into the Circles for Impact.

<strong> *SDG#5:*</strong> Gender Equality: As of 19 September 2022, only 13 women are in executive government positions as leaders of their countries/states.

Considering 193 member states in the United Nations, women in executive positions are represented as low as 6-7%, and that, sadly, also goes for the official peacemaking/sealing activities of course.

So that goes almost 50%/50% between genders with that egalitarian way, without having to wait more years on women's inclusion as them, official entitled to be the signers of a World Peace treaty.

<strong> *SDG#10:*</strong> Reduced inequalities within and among countries: In our case, it's also among people.

>> Remember? It's our right now, being a co-signer/sealer of a world peace treaty, even if we are not official signers of our countries/states. 


<strong>*SDG#16:*</strong> Peace, justice and strong institutions >> we'd like to empower United Nations and all the states to build and boost civic capacity for such goals and causes. 


<strong>*SDG#17:*</strong> Partnerships for the goals (this should be clear by now.)

So that's the consensus we got there,as in a common sense and understanding as well a high level of generosity and intentionality. Well, internationality as well :)


The collaboration spaces of Circles for Impact are being designed to exist as [metaverse-like virtual environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7AvWng7J8), for impact generating and scaling learnings and cooperations around making of [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/) and [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) centric projects, with communication, coordination, collaboration and resolution tools and more to bring in. It's all there, we're just focusing existing technology, and for the new ones, using the simplest possible approach.
<!-- 
For example, check these smart contracts. They are the easiest contracts one can write, and they are derived from simple storage contracts. Only storing one struct. 

[Expression of Peace V3](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeaceV3.sol) haven't yet been deployed to blockchain yet. 

>> There one can observe, that functions provide a granularity and combinations around behaviors such as anonymity/publicity and citizenship/world residency, depending on how people would make their expressions. This way we can get insights and provide public data through function names, and see what is the trend.  -->
<!-- 
This whole thing, experience of these tools and notions, are already happens with world residency manner, with a high level of generosity, yet we are bringing in citizenship info as well, so we represent not only ourselves, but our background, existing culture. And show how peaceful we are. And how good that will feel, to detach from the status-quo.

and the existing [Acknowledgement of Peace](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeace.sol) V2(soon) as well deployed in parallel. 


along with finalising resolutions in a [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) experience as they developed in time. That's how good it's gotta be.

<!-- >> These virtual spaces, will be designed together, and launched @  circlesforimpact . org throughout the following weeks/months with joint efforts by artists, designers, developers, community catalyzers, policy makers and people of any peaceful background. -->

>> spoiler: Those collaboration groups will not be isolated, nor dedicated to only one goal/problem to solve. It's all connected, we'll see a lot combinatorics and fusions in their states of coexistance.


What's next?
--
What we want, before 2022 ending is wrapping up the token research and engineering for incentive tokens @ [Optimistic Flow of Peace](https://expressionsofpeace.org/an-optimistic-flow-of-peace.png). 

And as of 2023, a Decentralized Exchange will be initiated for those incentive tokens and for Circles for Impact, and a set of crypto tokens of abstract type $cause will be defined and minted, for the actual funding of those projects. (eg. $food $education $air $water ..)

 They could have been only one token, called $impact, but what we want is not that. We'd like to observe this diversity of challenges, and of course, see how needs interrelate and that being kept as measurable as possible. 

 It might be the case that, $impact would be a platform token, and go into public swaps and kind of, brings in value back to other tokens in tis $cause DEX.
 
 Feel free to start a world peace project of your imagination, that's the whole point of our efforts. 
 
 What matters is that we all catalyze a world peace, and live and leave a priceless legacy, that is more about being, than having. 

 By and for all.
