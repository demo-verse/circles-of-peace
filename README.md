## Circles of Peace for +Impact ~ aka. Circles for +Impact.
## Peace, as a start:

This platform, [Circles for Impact](https://circlesforimpact.org), is a place to come together and give the least assurance to the rest of the world, as citizens or as-is, by default, as world residents.

Experience and features of this platform is quite similar to Twitter. We ere using the group module of [Orbis Protocol](https://orbis.club), an open sourced social tools and solutions provider. 

This is a hybrid solution, including components both in web2 and web3.

Through expressions, acknowledgements, reflections and later attestations of peace, we'd like to interpret basic social media interactions for an initial set of peace and trust making activities. 

![Interpretation of social media interactions for peacemaking](https://i.imgur.com/U8qgEdP.png)

Peacemakers that have expressed and acknowledged peace through Circles of +Impact, and given that assurance, will be invited to virtual collaboration spaces based on causes they want to imagine and build solutions together, and get funded., eg. workadventu,re, welo.space and gather.town to start with. 

In these environment, we'll be observing people, as sovereign individuals, that taken the least effort on being equal on peace and trust making, via a mimicry of peace-oriented diplomacy, which is here being decentralised, for the 21st century.

On that sense, platform will be acting as a (mental) gateway for collaboration, that manifests this worldview: 

**first make peace, then collaborate.**

@ Circles for Impact, we will not have moderation or censorship, nor a centralised data store. 

As is, all it takes to get into the platform is having a [metamask wallet](https://ceramic.network/) installed on your web browser. Interactions on this web3 social media will not cost or require signing your messages all the time. 


All data for Expressions and Reflections of Peace will be publicly available and immutable/non-changeable through a decentralised data store, called [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network/), which is the data persistence layer Orbis Protocol is using under the hood.

For that purpose, we are preparing an initial draft for a terms of use, and certificates/documents to be generated on-demand, eg.in the forms of [Non-fungible Tokens / NFTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) and those certificates, when listed (to sell or display-only) will be part of the Library of Peace, an NFT marketplace as what's done here is an Art of Peace.




<!-- We will be sending $peace and $wisdom tokens and one of  official/platform NFTs dedicated by artists in our existing community on discord, for you to access to Peacemakers community on orbis.club // there you will be invited to Circles for Impact, right away.

<strong> *SDG#5: Gender Equality:*</strong> As of 19 September 2022, only 13 women are in executive government positions as leaders of their countries/states.

Considering 193 member states in the United Nations, women in executive positions are represented as low as 6-7%, and that, sadly, also goes for the official peacemaking/sealing activities of course.

So that goes almost 50%/50% between genders with that egalitarian way, without having to wait more years on women's inclusion as them, official entitled to be the signers of a World Peace treaty.

<strong> *SDG#10: Reduced inequalities within and among countries:*</strong>  In our case, it's also among people.



>> "Everyone is free to be proactive, claim their equality, and use their free will to participate in a World Peace treaty, and be a legitimate co-signer of it, regardless of their entitlement, being official or not."

^ This human right, concept, perspective and notion shall be a canvas; on which our kind making Art of Peace, together. 


<strong>*SDG#16: Peace, justice and strong institutions*</strong>  We'd like to empower United Nations and all the states to build and boost civic capacity for peace and all goals and causes. All interconnected. 


<strong>*SDG#17: Partnerships for the goals: *</strong>  This should be clear by now.

So that's the consensus we got there,as in a common sense and understanding as well a high level of generosity and intentionality. Well, internationality as well :)

<strong>*Good news:*</strong>  as we use our right on being equal on peace and trust making, and express & acknowledge that for one another explicitly, we are somehow, already fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goals [5](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal5),[10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10), [16](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16) and [17](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17), before moving to virtual spaces of +Impact generating projects that are going to be full of educational sessions, and collaboration around co-imagination, ideation, making and funding of projects with partners, grants and investments.

----


The collaboration spaces of Circles for Impact are been co-imagined and designed to exist as [metaverse-like virtual environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7AvWng7J8), for impact generating and scaling learnings and cooperations around making of [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/) and [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) centric projects, with communication, coordination, collaboration and resolution tools and more to bring in. It's all there, we're just focusing existing technology, and for the new ones, using the simplest possible approach.
<!-- 
For example, check these smart contracts. They are the easiest contracts one can write, and they are derived from simple storage contracts. Only storing one struct. 

[Expression of Peace V3](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeaceV3.sol) haven't yet been deployed to blockchain yet. 

>> There one can observe, that functions provide a granularity and combinations around behaviors such as anonymity/publicity and citizenship/world residency, depending on how people would make their expressions. This way we can get insights and provide public data through function names, and see what is the trend.  -->
<!-- 
This whole thing, experience of these tools and notions, are already happens with world residency manner, with a high level of generosity, yet we are bringing in citizenship info as well, so we represent not only ourselves, but our background, existing culture. And show how peaceful we are. And how good that will feel, to detach from the status-quo.

and the existing [Acknowledgement of Peace](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeace.sol) V2(soon) as well deployed in parallel. 


along with finalising resolutions in a [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) experience as they developed in time. That's how good it's gotta be.

<!-- >> These virtual spaces, will be designed together, and launched @  circlesforimpact . org throughout the following weeks/months with joint efforts by artists, designers, developers, community catalyzers, policy makers and people of any peaceful background. -->

>> spoiler: Those collaboration groups will not be isolated, nor dedicated to only one goal/problem to solve. It's all connected, we'll see a lot combinatorics and fusions in their states of coexistance.


What's next?
--
What we want, before 2022 ending is wrapping up the token research and engineering for incentive tokens @ [Flow of Peace V2](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOX94E5k=/?share_link_id=267054985896). 

And as of 2023, a Decentralized Exchange will be initiated for those incentive tokens and for Circles for Impact, and along with the initial utility and appreciation tokens ($peace and $wisdom), an initial set of investment tokens of $cause(s) will be defined and minted, for the actual funding of +impact projects. (eg. $food $education $air $water ..)

 They could have been only one token, called $impact, but what we want is not that. We'd like to observe this diversity of challenges, and of course, see how needs interrelate and that being kept as measurable as possible. 

 It might be the case that, $impact would be a platform token, and go into public swaps and kind of, brings in value back to other tokens in tis $cause DEX.
 
 Feel free to start a world peace project of your imagination, that's the whole point of our efforts. 
 
 What matters is that we all catalyze a world peace, and live and leave a priceless legacy, that is more about being, than having. 

 By and for all.

 In the main project, [demoVerse](https://demoVer.se), and focused one, 

[A World Peace](https://aworldpeace.org),  we'll be incorporating and collaborating with Orbis Protocol, for the social layer of peace and trust-making; as resilience and transparency being on top priority for our efforts, all along.

In the meantime, launched as of 5th of November, we have started [Expressions of Demand](https://expressionsofdemand.org) to boost this decentralised diplomacy movement with a political dimension brought into place: 

*A proactive electorship, with civic sanctions. That will be part of Circles of Impact and peacemakers will be able to include them as an attachments to their Expressions of Peace.*

Between August to October 2022, we have made way through a proof of concept decentralised app/ DApp, [Expressions of Peace](https://expressionsofpeace.org), and people from several countries have experienced how fun and easy peace and trustmaking can be.

Circles of Peace for +Impact* , is being built on top of the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) and its use case, [Orbis groups](https://app.orbis.club) this very repository is forked. 

With these infrastructure, developers can use to create decentralized and composable social applications and features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers).
