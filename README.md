## Circles of Peace, a gateway to Circles for Impact
In the main project, [demoVerse](https://demoVer.se), and focused one, [Expressions of Peace](https://expressionsofpeace.org),  we'll be incorporating and collaborating with Orbis Protocol, as social layer to peace and trust-making, for resilience and transparency being on top priority for us. 

Circles of Peace* , is being built using the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) that developers can use to created decentralized and composable social applications and features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers). 

Peacemakers that have expressed and acknowledged peace, and given that assurance, will be invited to Circles of Peace (social component) and Circles for Impact (metaverse-like virtual spacse, eg. welo.space and gather.town).


In those environments/spaces, we'll be observing people, as sovereign individuals, taken the least effort on being equal on peace and trust making, via a mimicry of peace-oriented diplomacy, as that's being decentralised, for the 21st century.

It'll be embedded to our community discussion layer, and be a gateway to Circles for Impact.

>> we will be sending $peace and $wisdom tokens and one of  official/platform NFTs dedicated by artists in our existing community on discord, for you to access to Peacemakers community on orbis.club // there you will be invited to Circles for Impact, right away.

>> wait a second ...

>> isn't this a lot of effort to make it to a place where we want to quickly start making +impact? 

>> well, it might just be so. that's why, we would completely switch to orbis sdk, and a Post, basically becomes an expression of peace, and interactions would be acknowledgements of peace. 

>> that was how we've imagined so far, already. then we would make expressions and acknowledgements of peace channels non-gated, and create invitation channel(s) for the Circles for Impact environments from there. // feels like this is more like it..

Peace, as a start:
--
Good news: as we use our right on being equal on peace and trust making, and express & acknowledge that for one another explicitly, we are somehow, already fulfilling UN Sustainable Development Goals [10](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal10), [16](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal16) and [17](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal17), before moving into the Circles for Impact.

Through Expressions and Acknowledgements of Peace (and later with Attestations and Recognitions of Peace)m

<strong> *SDG#10:*</strong> Reduced inequalities within and among countries: In our case, it's also among people.

>> Remember? It's our right now, being a co-signer/sealer of a world peace treaty, even if we are not official signers of our countries/states. 


<strong>*SDG#16:*</strong> Peace, justice and strong institutions


<strong>*SDG#17:*</strong> Partnerships for the goals

So that's the consensus we got there,as in a common sense and understanding as well a high level of generosity and intentionality. Well, internationality as well :)


Circles are being designed to be [metaverse-like virtual spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7AvWng7J8), for impact generating and scaling learnings and cooperations around making of [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/) and [Inner Development Goals](https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/) centric (and more) projects, with communication, coordination, collaboration and resolution tools and more to bring in. It's all there, we're just focusing existing technology, and for the new ones, using the simplest possible approach.

For example, check these smart contracts. They are the easiest contracts one can write, and they are derived from simple storage contracts. Only storing one struct. 

[Expression of Peace V3](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeaceV3.sol) haven't yet been deployed to blockchain yet. 

>> There one can observe, that functions provide a granularity and combinations around behaviors such as anonymity/publicity and citizenship/world residency, depending on how people would make their expressions. This way we can get insights and provide public data through function names, and see what is the trend. 

This whole thing, experience of these tools and notions, are already happens with world residency manner, with a high level of generosity, yet we are bringing in citizenship info as well, so we represent not only ourselves, but our background, existing culture. And show how peaceful we are. And how good that will feel, to detach from the status-quo.

and the existing [Acknowledgement of Peace](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeace.sol) V2(soon) as well deployed in parallel. 


along with finalising resolutions in a [Liquid Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy) experience as they developed in time. That's how good it's gotta be.

>> These virtual spaces, will be launched @  circlesforimpact . org in the following weeks. Not there yet. 

>> spoiler: those circles will not be that isolated or dedicated to only one goal/problem to solve. It's all connected, we'll see a lot combinatorics and fusions in their states of coexistance.



What's next?
--
What we want, before 2022 ending is wrapping up the token research and engineering for incentive tokens @ [Optimistic Flow of Peace](https://expressionsofpeace.org/an-optimistic-flow-of-peace.png). 

And as of 2023, initiate a Decentralized Exchange for those incentive tokens and for Circles for Impact, define quite bunch of tokens of abstract type $cause, for the actual funding of those projects. (eg. $food $education $air $water ..)

 They could have been only one token, called $impact, but what we want is not that. We'd like to observe this diversity of challenges, and of course, see how needs interrelate and that being kept as measurable as possible. 

 It might be the case that, $impact would be a platform token, and go into public swaps and kind of, brings in value back to other tokens in tis $cause DEX.
 
 Feel free to start a world peace project of your imagination, that's the whole point of our efforts. 
 
 What matters is that we all catalyze a world peace, and live and leave a priceless legacy, that is more about being, than having. 

 By and for all.
