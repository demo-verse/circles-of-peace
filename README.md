## Circles of Peace aka. Circles for Impact
@ [demoVer.se](https://demoVer.se) and [expressionsofpeace.org]()https://expressionsofpeace.org, we'll be using Orbis Protocol, so will not be relying solely on centralized alternatives for resilience and transparency being on top priority for us.

Circles of Peace* , is being built using the [Orbis SDK](https://orbis.club/developers) that developers can use to created decentralized and composable social applications and features very easily. The SDK documentation can be accessed [here](https://orbis.club/developers). 

It'll be embedded to our community discussion layer, and a gateway to our [metaverse-like virtual spaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek7AvWng7J8) we're building for @ demoVerse, for impact generating and scaling learnings and cooperations around making of those projects, along with resolutions and a Liquid Democracy experience.

and will be gated for those expressed and acknowledged peace, and given that assurance as citizen or world resident behaviors, as of [Expression of Peace V3](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeaceV3.sol) and [Acknowledgement of Peace](https://github.com/demo-verse/expressions-of-peace/blob/main/contracts/ExpressionOfPeace.sol) V2(soon) as well deployed in parallel.
